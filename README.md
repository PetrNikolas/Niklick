## Project Setup
* For production, you need to replace the asterisk with the URL of your client-side application in ./config/initializers/cors.rb file.

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `rake db:create`
4. Run `bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development`
5. Run `bin/rails db:seed RAILS_ENV=development`
6. Run `foreman start`
7. Visit --> http://localhost:5000/. That's it!.

## Development
1. Run `foreman start -f Procfile.dev` for run your front-end and server-side application.
2. Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

### Just only backend side development
1. Run `foreman start`.
2. And visit http://localhost:5000/.

### Just only frontend side development
1. Run `foreman start`.
2. And visit http://localhost:5000/.

## GraphQL API playground
* Open `http://localhost:5000/graphiql` and play with GraphQL.

## PgHero dashboard
* Open `http://localhost:5000/pghero/` and that's it!.

## Sending emails
* In `app/mailers/user_notifier_mailer.rb` is method for sending emails. 
* In `app/views/User_notifier/send_signup_email.html.erb` is html template for emails.
* In `config/environment.rb` is ActionMailer settings to point to SendGridâ€™s servers.
* You can modify all files and use it in controller with `UserNotifier.send_signup_email(@user).deliver`
or you can use Job for sending emails with `SendEmailJob.set(wait: 20.seconds).perform_later(@user)`.

## Jobs (for production environment)
You can start jobs with `bundle exec rake jobs:work`.

## Code analyzer, linter, bundle audit and tools
* Run `rubocop` for Ruby lint.
* Run `rubocop -a` for fixed some issues automatically.
* Run `reek .` for analyzing code.
* Run `fasterer` for code analyzer.
* Run `bundle audit` for audito your bundle.
* Run `brakeman` for static analysis and for security vulnerabilities.
* Run `rails_best_practices .` in root app directory. Helps to find unused methods, missing indexes into database tables and many other things.

## Gitlab CI
* You need configure `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with your Heroku credentials.

## Docker
* Basic configuration of Docker image is in Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files in root of project.

### Docker Compose useful commands
```shell
# Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service:
$ docker-compose up

# Lists containers:
$ docker-compose ps

# Managing containers lifecycle:
$ docker-compose [start|stop|kill|restart|pause|unpause|rm] SERVICE

# Displays log output from services.:
$ docker-compose logs [SERVICE...]

# Run arbitrary commands in your services:
$ docker-compose exec SERVICE COMMAND

# Runs a one-time command against a service.:
$ docker-compose run SERVICE [COMMAND]

# Rebuilding a Docker Image:
$ docker-compose build [SERVICE...]
```

## Pry initializer
Avoid repeating yourself, use pry-rails instead of copying the initializer to every rails project.
* Run `rails console` and in Rails console:
* For showing models --> `show-models`.
* For showing routes --> `show-routes`.

## Test API with Postman
```shell
headers: "accept: application/json", "version: version=1", "access-token: v9S2milc1aEcx4hhIGupbg", "client: LCYog4PFg_PN_eCVWyQtYw", "expiry: 1515865278", "uid: your@email.com"
method: POST
